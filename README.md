# Customer-Segmentation-Model
A customer segmentation model in Python

RFM Analysis is a data-driven customer segmentation technique that aims to cluster different customers into groups based on their transactional data , particularly based on how recently they have transacted (Recency), how frequently they typically transact (Frequency), and how much they have spent so far (Monetary Value). 

The result of this Analysis can help businesses to identify their customer's behavior and also make decisons based on these attributes.

About the project: For the purpose of this project, I will be an RFM model using an Online Retail Listing data set found on Kaggle
